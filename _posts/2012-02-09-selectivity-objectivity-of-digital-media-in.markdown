A challenge often heard in relation to ethnography, especially newer netnographic & social media based approaches, is that the selectivity, production and curation of media makes it a invalid observational record. This position views the content used by ethnographers as ‘objective data’ which shouldn’t be slurried by the intentions or creativity of the ethnographer. However, [Sarah Pink offers three criticisms of this position in relation to video](http://books.google.com/books/about/Doing_visual_ethnography.html?id=0ksmBt1jJnIC), but they also hold up in relation to other forms of media.

1. Collecting digital media (video, pictures, audio) in a undisturbed or objective way is often a impossibility. When people’s behaviour is captured by any sort of media they ‘play up for the camera’ (or microphone). It follows that most media constructed to a greater or lesser extent.

2. Knowledge doesn’t necessarily exist as observable facts. Knowledge is produced through experience, through a interaction between the researcher and the subject matter. Not all knowledge is in the form of a objective reality which can be captured, recorded and stored.

3. Objectivity isn’t just a matter of a researchers intentions. Objectivity is contextual. At it’s broadest, media is objective when it is deemed to be objective when it’s viewers.

By adopting a contextual view of digital media’s objectivity you’re able to broaden the types, genres and sources of media you are able to include in a research project.
