title: Natural data collection biases in quantified self

I’ve been experimenting on myself and collecting all sorts of data about my mood, who I’m with, when I’m working, etc. It’s a great way to understand yourself better. I even made a [website called N = One](http://nequalsone.me) for some of the data I collected.

There’s only one problem; the data looks weird. Here’s an example:

At a glance, this chart tells you I spend most of my time either with nobody or strangers. The data was collected using the excellent [Reporter App](http://www.reporter-app.com/) which you can see below. Reporter beeps you at random points during the day and asks you to fill out a short survey.

This is a great way to collect data, especially if you do it over an extended period of time.

But it’s only great if you actually fill out the survey. What I realized when I looked at my data is that I was less likely to answer the beeps to fill out the survey when I was working or with friends. When I was riding the subway or in a cab, I would answer the survey straightaway. 

So what’s the solution? I could become more disciplined and always answer the call of the survey. I could weight certain answers knowing that some answers are more likely to be ignored than others. For example, each time I answer that I’m with friends, I’ve probably ignored the survey on three other occasions. Therefore, one “I’m with friends” answer is actually worth three.

New ideas and technology are always pushing us to rethink how we approach research. The idea of quantified self is no different. With its unique benefits come unique challenges and the first step forward is figuring out what these benefits and challenges are.
