title: Everytime you produce a bad graph a fairy dies

Whilst it’s unconfirmed that the production of awful charts leads to the death of small mythical beings, I’m pretty sure bad graphs are killing something which is at least as important as fairies.

*I believe bad graphs kill ideas.*

And ideas are one of the most important things we, the market research industry have. With the increased sophistication of cheap, easily available online tools; the collection and presentation of data is no longer the exclusive domain of market researchers. Anyone with an internet connection can do it relatively easily.

### Our purpose?

This leads us to the question - if we are no longer kings of the collection and presentation of data, what is our purpose? What do market researchers bring to the table? Why shouldnt the market researcher go the same way as the Dodo? And some of the answer lies in the clever things we do with numbers, we understand weighting, sampling theory, conjoint analysis… But another part of the answer lies in the ideas we have; born out of an in depth knowledge and understanding of how the human condition interacts with business.

As a result of this, one of the most important challenges we face is communicating our ideas to the people who can act upon them. There are lots of things we can do to help communicate our ideas, but one thing I've learnt over the past year is that the way we visualise data is of the upmost importance. A good graph can make the difference between someone thinking I understand this and Im going to do something about it and someone giving you the blank expression which tells you theyve switched off and they are going to let your ideas die by the wayside.

### I’m not the only one

I don’t expect you to take my word for it. But Im not the first person to come to this conclusion. History is rich with examples of graphs which made a difference.

Let’s take Florence Nightingale - nurse, Lady with the Lamp, social reformist, and it turns out producer of wonderful data visualisations. Nightingale produced a number of booklets which highlighted the plight of soldiers fighting in the Crimean war. One of Nightingales most famous diagrams was a polar area pie chart or Nightingales Rose, which with a clarity rarely seen, shows that many more soldiers where dying of disease than being wounded by the enemy. For anyone in the army at that time, this diagram must have provided a strong reason to do something about the unhygienic conditions in army hospitals.

And producing good data visualisations does not require you to be a master artist. There has been a massive buzz around whole area of infographics over the past few years. This has led a number of great websites like Flowing Data & Information is Beautiful. If books are more your thing I wholeheartedly recommend the works of Edward Tufte and Stephen Few. Theres also a range of tools which can help you produce data visualisations, vector graphics packages like Adobe Illustrator & Inkscape are great. There are some specialist tools which can be used to wonderful effect like Processing, R, Gephi and Tableau.

### Is this the best way to put my idea across?

So if like me, you think that ideas are important and they are worth doing something about. Then surely we owe it ourselves, or at the very least to our clients or the people we work for, to make sure our ideas have the best chance possible of being heard. So when your next looking at a PowerPoint slide and your about to use yet another templated graph, ask yourself.

*Is this really the best way of getting people to buy in to my idea?*
