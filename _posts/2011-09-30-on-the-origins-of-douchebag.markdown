Douchebag, what a word. But where did one of America's premier insults come from?

Wikipedia defines Douchebag as:

> "The term usually refers to a person, usually male, with a variety of negative qualities, specifically arrogance and engaging in obnoxious and/or irritating actions, most often without malicious intent."

Which is as good as a definition as any. Most sources seem to agree that the term douchebag originated as a pejorative sometime during ’30s. By the ’60s. It was originally used to refer to a “unattractive co-ed” or a “woman of loose moral repute”. When the term switched genders, moving from a female focused insult to a male one is unknown.

By the ’70s & ’80s douchebag had developed into a general insult towards males. By the ’00s the term had come to describe a certain type of male gelled, bronzed, buff and with [“an over-inflated sense of self worth, compounded by a low level of intelligence”](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=douchebag).

Throughout the 00s douchebag rose in popularity, by 2008 [a readers letter to Gawker.com declared the term “completely played out” and should be dropped from people’s vocabulary](http://gawker.com/5113454/farewell-douchebag).
