In fiction androids are often portrayed without emotion because mimicking emotion is difficult or dangerous. However there’s a problem with this idea; emotions effect everything people think & do. Emotion is not a optional add-on it’s central to how people behave and process information. Emotion plays a part every form of cognition, including memory, decision making & problem solving. The exclusion of emotion from areas like, information-processing models of cognitive psychology, scientific management & marketing research has already led people to question the usefulness of such approaches in understanding human behaviour. With this in mind, if your goal was to create a robot which mimics a human, surely it would be difficult to create one without emotions.
