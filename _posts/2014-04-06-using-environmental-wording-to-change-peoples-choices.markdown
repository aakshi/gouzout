People's default choices are fascinating: What these choices are, how they come about, and how to change them are of huge importance to businesses, brands, and even governments. To satisfy my own curiosity, I wanted to run the simplest possible experiment to understand people's default choices and how they can be altered. I decided on the color of flowers—for no particular reason other than it was simplest question I could think of and something to which everyone can relate.

I ran two single open question surveys using Google's Consumer Surveys. The first condition was: *"You're walking through a garden. You pick a flower. What color is it?"*  . The second condition was: *"You're walking through a bright, sunny garden. You pick a flower. What color is it?"* — the only addition being the words *bright* and *sunny*.

The consistency of answers and difference between the two conditions was bigger than I imagined for such a frivolous question. “Red” was the answer of more than one-third (35%) in the control condition and 28% in the bright-sunny condition — a pretty decent default.

But an interesting change occurred in the bright-sunny condition: There was a significant increase in the number of people who answered “yellow.” In the control condition, 20% of people defaulted to yellow, but with the addition of the bright-sunny text, this jumped to 33%.
