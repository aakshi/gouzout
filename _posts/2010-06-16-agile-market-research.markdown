How can market research provide better insight for it’s clients? It’s a question that needs asking and part of the answer could lie in simple research. By simple I do not mean simplistic, dumbed down, quick or even dirty. By simple we’re talking things like clear, accessible, focused.

Rather than trying to cover off every research objective in one large project, lets do research in baby steps, into simple mini-projects, with each step providing just enough *"insight"* to make a difference for whoever it’s being conducted for.

### A explanation

Whilst not true of many projects, my sweeping generalisation is that too many market research projects play out something like this… the project takes about 6 weeks to complete. It will be triggered by a handful of objectives outlined in a research brief. These objectives translate in a herd of hypotheses. A researcher then attempts to test all the hypotheses at once in a single, long, complex, survey. By at which point both researchers and participants are positively catatonic with joy. There are few problems with this approach (beyond the arguments against bad survey design and poor treatment of participants) :

- Because you are tied to a single method during the project you have stick with it no matter what may occur during the course of a project or what external events may change its relevance. For example your half through a project and you discover that the company your working for has started leaking millions of gallons of oil into the sea. Ideally you’d like to be able to tweak your project to take this into account. Unfortunately stuck on a single path for the next six weeks, like a supertanker it’s difficult manoeuvre. 

- By trying to do too much in one go, the issues, objectives, hypotheses are confused. Which leads to unfocused conclusions which no one can act upon. Research is only effective if people understand it, even if you’ve conducted the most exquisite piece of research in the history of the world ever. It’s all going to fall apart if people switch off because you’ve tried to explain too much at once.

You can get round these issues by adopting a approach which breaks a research project down into smaller related projects. Each of these projects are setup, conducted & analysed independently but in context:

- By working with a series of small projects we have more opportunities to tweak our approach based on external changes or learnings from the previous projects. 

- Using small projects frees us from the shackles of using the same methodology or approach all the way through. One project could be a survey, the next a qualitative task, the next buzz research. - Each project is focused on finding out just enough to make a difference, as such it is easier to communicate and develop actions from. 

- Both researcher, client (and even participant) can get feedback more quickly, there’s a feeling that your always progressing.

### Old idea new application

Modularising projects into smaller parts isn’t new, [project management techniques like SCRUM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)) use this sort of approach all the time. And there was a [recent article in The Psychologist which argues for minimally sufficient research in psychology](http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_23-editionID_188-ArticleID_1672-restricted_true), which is pretty much what I’m saying here. It’s just that these sorts of approaches haven’t been used by market research, because until recently the technology hasn’t been available to make it easy enough and therefore cheap enough to not have to bundle all of our objectives together into large projects.

### More on money

The big problem with this approach is that it could end up being expensive; if you approach this philosophy in a traditional manner your going to incur the costs associated with setup and bureaucracy with every single step you take. However the internet changes things. It’s a lot quicker an easier to setup projects, things can be copied & tweaked rapidly. Cheap readily available tools like SurveyGizmo/Monkey are already available. There may be some costs associated in recruiting participants to take part on more than one occasion, but this is negligible, especially if spend some time understanding what motivates people to take part in your research.

### It’s already happening

This approach of breaking research projects into smaller steps and tweaking the research as you go is already happening. This is how well run MROC’s (Market Research Online Communities) run. A traditional adhoc brief is far to big to be researched on a community all in one go. So the brief is divided into smaller steps each of which seek to complete one of the objectives. The following objectives are covered off in the days which follow. Because the MROC is already setup, you already have access to participants and a range of different qualitative & quantitative research tools to conduct each of the steps with.

### Ain’t no silver bullet

I should go without saying, but this sort of approach isn’t suitable for every project/person/organisation. However I think we need better ways of running research projects and this sort of approach could be one of them.
