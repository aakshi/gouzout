        <title>Angry Red Car</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“No, no, no.” the man driving the red car in my blind spot has wound down his window and is shouting “No, no, no.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s shouting at me. His balding head red with anger, his left arm shaking back and forth vigorously, accenting his glorious shade of rouge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I speed up slightly, driving south through Seattle.  It’s a city I don’t know well, and I’m trying to get on to the SR99 highway. Unfortunately, I’m the left lane, and I’ve just seen a sign indicating the entrance to the highway is on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traffic is heavy but flowing. I’m indicating right, hoping a kind soul will make room for me to switch lanes. As we crawl forward, I look over my right shoulder; there’s a man in his late 40’s maybe 50’s listening to white earbud headphones in a white Hyundai. Why is he listening to headphones in the car? There’s no time to ponder. The entrance to the highway is slowly approaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look at him expectantly, with a look that mixes puppy-dog-eyes with a steely decisiveness. He pretends he doesn’t see me and speeds up, just enough to make it clear there’s no chance I’m going to be able to switch lanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slow down slightly, the entrance to the highway draws closer, maybe the driver behind Mr. Ipod Head will be more charitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look over my right shoulder, puppy dog steel ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No, no, no.” it was the angry bald man taunting me again. He has somehow managed to weezel his way four cars forward to continue his shouty Amy Winehouse recital and accompanying fit of jazz hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at this point, still indicating right, still crawling towards the onramp, still hoping someone would give enough space for me to switch lanes, that I think to myself “What is fucking wrong with these guys.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Can’t they just see I’m an idiot who found himself in the wrong lane and is trying to correct his mistake.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was it; they didn’t. My fellow drivers didn’t see someone who had made a mistake and was trying to fix it. They saw someone who had made their way up the faster moving left lane; someone who was then trying to cut into traffic at the last moment, someone who hadn’t  patiently crawled along in the right lane with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t be angry at them, not Ipod Head nor Angry Red Car. Not because I realize my lane switching maneuvers were a minor automotive faux pas but because I’ve been doing the same thing they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misreading the world around me, developing bogus assumptions and drawing incorrect conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never thought the UK would vote to leave the European Union. The vote would be close, but there was no way we’d vote to leave.  I’d read articles, followed news stories, gossiped with my friends, monitored my Facebook, and Twitter feeds to divine the mood of the masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no way we’d vote to leave. But we did. I was wrong, so very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I regret not doing more to support remain. I blame myself, I looked at the data, lapped up the news and miscalled the outcome. I also blame Facebook, Twitter, the Guardian, the BBC, and Reddit. I know now I gleefully skipped into an echo chamber created not only by algorithms but also my habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s sad that an event as severe as Brexit had to occur to make me realize it. But there is something severely wrong with how I learn about what is happening in the world around me, how I consume news, how I casually pick up on information. Most of the time it doesn’t matter - until it does.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to plot multiple boxplots per category in R</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Boxplots are a great way to explore data and when doing modelling I often want to see how all the variables interact with a single target variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the code I use to publish all the Boxplots to a PDF for perusual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;mf-id-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mf-id-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/assets/posts/how-to-plot-multiple-boxplots-per-category-in-r/boxplot.svg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basic Boxplot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Plot all the boxplots :)
## Can only plot numeric data 
## Get the name of each numeric column
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;colnames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sapply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is.numeric&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;## Save boxplots to PDF
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;boxplots.pdf&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;## For each column in names create a boxplot
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;## Create formula for boxplot
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;## Target is typically a category / factor variable
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;as.formula&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;paste&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Target&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;~&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;boxplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ylab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xlab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Target&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dev.off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>How to customize slider labels in Shiny</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shiny.rstudio.com/&quot;&gt;Shiny&lt;/a&gt; offers a good selection of arguments to help you customize the slider input control. If you need to add a prefix or suffix to a label it’s easy to do in R. But, if you need more complicated reformating of labels Javascript is your friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the Shiny source code we can see that Shiny uses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ionden.com/a/plugins/ion.rangeSlider/en.html&quot;&gt;Ion Range Slider&lt;/a&gt; JQuery component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ion Range Slider has a number of additional settings we can tap into. To customize the rendering of the labels we’re going to use the Ion Range Slider &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;prettify&lt;/code&gt; setting which allows us to use a callback function to render our labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a Javascript file in your Shiny project called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;slider.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//Some sort of transformation happens here&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/**
  Tweak ionRangeSlider options
  prettify tells the ionRangeSlider to 
  use our createLabel function to
  render the slider labels
  */&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;slider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;#sliderOne&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ionRangeSlider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;prettify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next the custom Javascript needs to be added to the Shiny app using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;includeScript&lt;/code&gt; function to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ui.R&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shiny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shinyUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fluidPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Adds custom JS to head of Shiny HTML page
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;includeScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;slider.js&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the range slide component needs to be added the Shiny &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ui.R&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;mn-id-r-code-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt; ⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-id-r-code-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; the first argument for the sliderInput &lt;em&gt;sliderOne&lt;/em&gt; matches the id used in the Javascript file. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shiny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shinyUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fluidPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;  
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Adds custom JS to head of Shiny HTML page
&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;includeScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;slider.js&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;verticalLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wellPanel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sliderInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;sliderOne&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Slider with fancy labels:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;min&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;47&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Distinctive products, zombie and cannibal hordes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketingsociety.com/the-library/distinctive-products-and-avoiding-zombie-and-cannibal-hordes&quot;&gt;Originally published on the Marketing Society blog, August 10, 2014.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think that I know a little something about surviving a variety of world-ending scenarios. A childhood of computer games and films has left me prepared for zombie outbreaks, alien invasions and even a planet run by apes. One of the things I’ve learnt about surviving a catastrophe is that groups of things that look and act the same are generally something to be scared of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!----&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single zombie by itself? Not that scary – it’s a problem easily solved by a chainsaw to the back of the head. A sole alien? Not scary (unless you’re stuck on spaceship with little hope of rescue) – maybe the alien is even friendly and just wants to go home. An ape rides up on horseback holding a spear – weird, but not that scary. On the other hand, a horde of zombies wandering towards your house is never good. Thousands of aliens falling from the sky rarely ends well. A hundred apes riding a hundred horses towards your gated-community is going to make you wish you had built a taller gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this sameness and the fear that goes with it isn’t something I just have to face in the cinema. I see it every time I go shopping. Let’s take a look in the children’s shampoo aisle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/shampoo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Children&#39;s shampoo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the products come in similar plastic bottles, all the same size. The shampoo is always dispensed by pumping or squeezing. They are all liquid-gels, and there are pastel colours for babies and primary colours for toddlers. Almost all of them have the words ‘gentle’ and ‘tear free’ tattooed on the bottles. While most people will see cute fish and cartoon characters when viewing our line-up of suspects, I see a zombie horde heading for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not the only one who sees ghouls in the shopping aisles; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tnsglobal.com/press-release/zombie-and-cannibal-products-killing-consumer-brands&quot;&gt;a recent TNS study&lt;/a&gt; showed that 60% of new product launches in the UK are either ‘zombie’ products, products that fail to provide long-term growth, or ‘cannibal’ products, products that transfer consumers from one product in your portfolio to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As marketers, how do we avoid overseeing portfolios of zombies and cannibals? In a marketplace where there’s an abundance of similar products, both competitively and within our own portfolios, how can we create products that are geared towards new consumers and long-term growth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem comes in two parts. The first part is better product development,  which is the creation of innovative functions and experiences that differentiates a product from its peers. The second part is the creation of distinctive assets, such as a logo, messaging, and colour that makes a product easy to recognise. How do we make consumers actually feel something for the one product trying to break out of the horde?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re going to focus on the second part of the solution: how to create a distinctive product. How do you develop an easily recognizable logo, campaign or packaging for a product that remains true to the parent brand, is distinctive from other products within a portfolio and is appealing to customers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent projects on cars and insurance products, we’ve been developing distinct personalities for different products in a portfolio. The personality metaphor is used frequently in brand development but is underutilized in product launches. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/emerald-publishing/product-personality-and-its-influence-on-consumer-preference-Rsjvqxc10M&quot;&gt;There’s some evidence that developing distinctive product personalities can lead to increased customer preference&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pascallegovers.nl/uploads/1/2/3/9/12391484/govers_and_mugge_de2004.pdf&quot;&gt;for a product and consumers’ attachment to that product&lt;/a&gt;. But, to some extent, that doesn’t matter at this stage. Don’t view the personality of a product as an end in itself but as a heuristic that will take us from the messy and complex interactions between product, brand, consumers and competitors to distinctive assets like packaging and colour we mentioned before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of a distinctive product personality is a balancing act between the different and the complementary. On one hand, you want to develop a personality that is distinct from other products yet complements the personalities of consumers and the overarching brand. We’ve found that one of the best ways to do this is through social media research. The web is a huge interconnected network of consumer thoughts and feelings, and if you figure out how different personality attributes fit together, or not, it’s a great place to start to develop potential product personalities. Typically, we take the personality attributes of consumers, normally from a segmentation study; the personality of a brand (normally from the brand book, temple, onion, key or another lexicon used to articulate the brand archetype); and a selection of hypothetical product personality attributes for the products we want to investigate. This naturally occurring online data allows us to see if, when people talk about, say, “cute”, they associate “cute” with “cheerful” but never with “funny”. Layering exploratory network analysis with a qualitative interpretation yields rich, nuanced connections that can inspire the way you position a product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional benefit of a content-rich approach like this is that it allows you to get a deeper understanding of the personality attributes you’re investigating. For example, a brony is a different type of “cute” than that of a My Little Pony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve settled on the distinctive personality attributes for a product, you can start developing assets around them. For example, “cute” packaging may be more rounded than “reliable” packaging. Designers, in particular, are very good at this sort of reverse semiotics, or the creation of symbols from meaning, and planners find this a rich way to talk to creative teams about the subsequent advertising brief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating distinctive product assets like this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/How-Brands-Grow-What-Marketers/dp/0195573560&quot;&gt;increases the availability of your product to consumers both mentally - it’s top-of-mind - and physically – it’s easy to pick out in the store&lt;/a&gt;. The key to surviving a zombie apocalypse of the marketing variety isn’t to hide in the undergrowth, but it’s to stand out there, loud and proud, with a confident personality.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From big to friendly data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brianjuicerblog.wordpress.com/2014/07/28/from-big-to-friendly-data/&quot;&gt;Originally published on the Brian Juicer blog, July 28, 2014.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a slightly dorky game show inspired digital assistant that lives on my PlayStation called Max. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/numbers/why-netflix-loves-suspenseful-mad-scientists&quot;&gt;This Siri-like character guides you through choosing what to watch next on Netflix and comes with his very own game where you rate movies and TV shows on a five-star scale.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be willing to hazard a guess that the algorithms powering Max’s content suggestions are the same ones Netflix uses for its regular content recommendations, it’s just that Max’s suggestions feel so precise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I was in the house on my own, eating beige-coloured food and looking for something dramatic. Max offered up Zodiac, a Jake Gyllenhaal movie I had previously overlooked, but it was so right for a quiet Sunday night. This feeling of precision seems to come from two places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Max offers fewer recommendations – only half a dozen or so, while the regular Netflix screen offers dozens. Giving the user fewer recommendations makes them feel more precise. Secondly, you interact with Max, answer his questions and play the ratings game with him. These interactions build a sort of trust between you and the machine, again adding to that feeling of precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max isn’t the only bot on the block to pull the friendly card. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/08/super-computer-simulates-13-year-old-boy-passes-turing-test&quot;&gt;Eugene Goostman, the Turing test passing chatbot&lt;/a&gt;, wasn’t successful because he had the best algorithms or used most data. Eugene was successful because his makers framed people’s interactions with him with a backstory: Eugene is a 13-year-old boy from the Ukraine. Within this context the answers given by Eugene felt more precise, more real, and more human than they would without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another company using the same sort of friendly data techniques but in a much less dramatic way is Google Consumer Surveys. When you look at significant differences between proportions on Google Consumer Surveys it’s not percentages and p-values that are displayed in bold, it’s short sentences, like &lt;em&gt;“Among people in the US West, women picked Fetch with a toy more than men.”&lt;/em&gt; This is a lot easier and a lot more convincing than just displaying the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/numbers.png&quot; alt=&quot;&#39;Google consumer surveys results&#39;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trend towards friendly data harkens back to something that marketers have known for a long time and it’s part of the reason why marketing, insight and innovation should be deeply involved in data &amp;amp; analytics: it’s not what you say that makes a difference it’s how you make people feel. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/brainjuicer/the-long-and-the-short-of-it-final-32946471&quot;&gt;The lessons we’ve learnt about communication&lt;/a&gt; from TV spots, packaging and banners also apply to data, as big and unfriendly as it may seem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are loyalty programs effective?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The short answer is that we don’t know. There’s some evidence to suggest that loyalty programs are beneficial to businesses and consumers, but ultimately it’s not clear if loyalty programs are profitable or if they should be treated as a profit center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started to look through the literature on loyalty programs, I found out it’s large and often contradictory. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to stumble across &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2370.2011.00314.x/abstract;jsessionid=AD53CCD977CDBE5AF118B4AB2C679B8B.f01t03?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&quot;&gt;a recent literature review that gives a great summary of what researchers &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; and in someways more importantly &lt;em&gt;don’t know&lt;/em&gt; about the effectiveness of loyalty programs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visualization below splits my notes on the review into things we know and don’t know about loyalty programs. Click on the circles to zoom into each section. The smallest circles display a note giving some information on a particular aspect of loyalty programs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This isn’t the best marketing blog post you’ll ever read but, you probably shouldn’t buy Ab-Soul’s new album</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Secret-Life-Pronouns-Words/dp/1608194965&quot;&gt;James Pennebaker’s book The Secret Life of Pronouns&lt;/a&gt; that turned me on to how quirks in our language can predict future behavior. So, I was pleased when I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/mktg/assets/File/Dispreferred%20Markers_Hamilton%20Vohs%20McGill.pdf&quot;&gt;a paper that looks at how dispreferred markers affect how people feel about a brand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have no idea what a dispreferred marker is, don’t worry; I had no idea either. A dispreferred marker is a phrase people use just before they deliver a negative comment; for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/24Kay__&quot;&gt;@24Kay__&lt;/a&gt; I liked it but I&amp;#39;m glad I didn&amp;#39;t pay for it&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; ⭐️ (@ilyJeremiah) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ilyJeremiah/statuses/481941253370560513&quot;&gt;June 25, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I liked it but…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dont mean to be mean but baby you need some Listerine&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cotey Durci (@cdurcii) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cdurcii/statuses/483693511746023424&quot;&gt;June 30, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I dont mean to be mean…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These markers don’t change the truth of a statement but act as an “emotive signal, acknowledging the potential for social awkwardness, or disagreement in the conversation.” The interesting thing about the research paper is that it goes beyond seeing dispreferred markers as a social signal, but instead as something that can affect subsequent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers ran a sequence of experiments, the most interesting being the fifth and final experiment, which investigated how dispreferred markers alter people’s view of the brand and how much they say they would pay for a watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this experiment, participants were split into two groups. One group saw an advert for an Oniss watch and a single customer review with a dispreferred marker, while the other group saw the same advert without the marker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/content/images/2014/Jul/Screenshot-2014-07-03-09-46-26.png&quot; alt=&quot;Review stimulus used in orginal experiment&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the group who saw the advert with the dispreferred marker would pay more for the watch than those who didn’t see the marker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study does a great job of demonstrating how reviews can affect the perception and stated value of a watch, but as someone who’s interested in marketing, I’d love to see if the same effect occurs when dispreferred markers are used in advertising copy or across categories. When and where does the dispreferred marker effect occur?  Maybe a little experiment is in order!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visual analytics, the girl-bar problem and brand positioning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A guy in the restroom of a dive bar in Manchester, England, checks his hair in a mirror and smiles, &lt;em&gt;the girl he’s been talking to for the past hour is definitely into him.&lt;/em&gt; He heads back out to the bar, looks across the room—the girl is gone. “Kebab,” he mutters to himself. &lt;em&gt;It really is the only sensible next step from here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this obviously entirely fictional story have to with how we develop new brand positioning? Much like the usually witty, charming, funny, young man in our story, brands can be poor judges on who they are and how they are perceived by others. Just because a brand book tells you that your brand radiates the personality of an ancient Viking warrior, it doesn’t mean that girls at bars—as our witty, charming friend assumed—or consumers see you that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can include consumers in any sort of brand development process. But, much like girls in bars, they can often be too polite and lovely to tell you that you have more in common with two-week-old organic lettuce than you do with a Viking warrior—and sometimes they run out on you when your back is turned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the traditional tools for brand development, such as archetypes and consumer co-creation, suffer from what will henceforth be known as the Rachel, wait, no, it was, Emily, problem. What are the alternatives? We need approaches that take the brand into account, but are consumer led, and avoid artificial conversations or even asking direct questions entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These criteria were at the top of my mind when I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://ditto.us.com/&quot;&gt;Ditto&lt;/a&gt;. Ditto is a new startup that has developed a technology that is like facial recognition technology, but for brand logos. Ditto’s system scours the web for images and sorts them based on the logos found in the images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.ditto.us.com/eb6/09b/425846369987739648_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ditto Visual Analytics of https://twitter.com/lillyalbelbais/status/425777177548713984&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Ditto’s tool could help with brand positioning as the images are all by consumers and reference a brand, but aren’t &lt;em&gt;for the brand&lt;/em&gt;. And if a picture is worth a 1000 words, maybe a collection of Instagram photos could make a pretty good collection of short stories? There was only one way to find out: run an experiment to see if the images tell us about how consumers view these brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I setup a Ditto project comparing two car brands, Volkswagen and Mazda. Over a one-month period, 6900 images (2700 Mazda and 4200 VW) were collected. These images were then categorized depending on where the image was taken, what was happening in the image and what emotion the analysts thought the image conveyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the images were tallied, a few interesting patterns emerged. For example, images that contain a Mazda logo are more likely to be seen in an “outdoorsy” setting with mountains and forests. Images with Volkswagen logos in them tended to include a Volkswagen car, while the Mazda logo was more likely to be seen without a car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this initial categorization was a useful way to organize the images, things got more interesting within the categories. For example, I looked at the way “happiness” manifested in images with Mazda or Volkswagen logos. In happy images with a Volkswagen logo, people were interacting with the logo, touching the logo at the Volkswagen factory, holding the steering wheel in a Volkswagen car or, in a few cases, making Volkswagen branded cupcakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mazda images categorized as happy had a different quality. In these images, the logo wasn’t the center of attention; it was a spectator on the side lines. Many images were of soccer fans before, during and after games, and there were a number of older photos uploaded reminiscing about good times with old Mazdas in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is useful information when developing new brand positioning. It tells you how your brand is seen by others and how it differs from other brands without being self-referencing and using leading questions. It, however, isn’t the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ditto nor any other technology is going to do the work for you. It’s not going to completely replace brand archetypes, CART models or co-creation, but it can make the work you do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is key for me. It’s rare to find a technology that’s a silver bullet, that solves all your problems, and it’s probably unfair to evaluate a technology on those terms. It’s better to ask, “Is the way I’m doing things today better than the way I was doing them yesterday?” Take these small wins on the days you can, and go eat kebabs on the days you can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What makes something #beautiful?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think it was in high school, in an English Literature lesson, someone was talking about how “beauty is in the eye of the beholder”, how beauty is an experience of the individual, that anything can be beautiful if someone considers it so. In some ways this is a nice idea, a free and easy way to understand the beauty around us, but is it true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, if beauty is entirely subjective, a product of individual preference, why is it so consistent? Scarlett Johansson is universally seen as beautiful, as are sunsets, vistas and diamonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how people see beauty today, I analyzed a 1000 pictures &lt;a href=&quot;http://iconosquare.com/tag/beautiful/&quot;&gt;tagged #beautiful on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;describing-pictures&quot;&gt;Describing pictures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyze 1000 pictures by hand is error prone and time consuming. So to get an overview of what people considered beautiful, I tagged the images using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alchemyapi.com/products/features/image-tagging/&quot;&gt;machine vision API created by Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;. The machine vision API works somewhat like facial recognition software. It looks at an image and returns a list of tags, saying what it thinks the image contains. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://demo1.alchemyapi.com/images/vision/emaxfpo.jpg&quot;&gt;this image&lt;/a&gt; is 99% likely to contain a cat, 57% likely to contain an animal and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what was contained within our 1000 #beautiful images?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bl.ocks.org/richshaw/raw/0a7a1dd78bf1882c67fa/&quot;&gt;What is beautiful? Bubble Chart.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;    
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Bubble chart&quot; src=&quot;/assets/posts/what-makes-something-beautiful/bubble-chart.svg &quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bubble chart above shows the number of times each tag occurred. I don’t want to conclude that, as humans, we are a race of narcissists, but we do have a lot of beautiful people, but also some sunsets, sky and sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also look at an average of images for different tags to see if there’s any consistency in color and composition of the images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;fullwidth image-quilt js-packery&quot; data-packery-options=&quot;{ &amp;quot;itemSelector&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;.image-quilt-item&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;gutter&amp;quot;: 0 }&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;image-quilt-item&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Average #beautiful person&quot; src=&quot;/assets/beautiful-average/person.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;image-quilt-item&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Average #beautiful girl&quot; src=&quot;/assets/beautiful-average/girl.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;image-quilt-item&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Average #beautiful model&quot; src=&quot;/assets/beautiful-average/model.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;image-quilt-item&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Average #beautiful sport&quot; src=&quot;/assets/beautiful-average/sport.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;image-quilt-item&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Average #beautiful nature&quot; src=&quot;/assets/beautiful-average/nature.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;image-quilt-item&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Average #beautiful sunset&quot; src=&quot;/assets/beautiful-average/sunset.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;image-quilt-item&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Average #beautiful cat&quot; src=&quot;/assets/beautiful-average/cat.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average images were created by taking the average pixel color, for each pixel across all the images of a tag. Much like numeric averages, average images don’t tell us much about the overall structure of the data but give us a single point of reference for commonalities within the data. In this case the average images give us a feel for the common composition and colors used within the images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the bubble chart and averages tell us about the common tags, it doesn’t tell us anything about how the tags relate to each other. What is related to “people”? What sports are included in “sport”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bl.ocks.org/richshaw/raw/b7f99f539e2a2546ab64/&quot;&gt;What is beautiful? Network Graph.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Bubble chart&quot; src=&quot;/assets/posts/what-makes-something-beautiful/network-graph.svg &quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network graph above shows how the tags fit together. Each circle represents a tag, and a line is draw between tags that are mentioned together. We can see that beautiful flowers include “orchid,” “poppy” and “dandelion” and sports like “football,” “golf” and even “wrestling” have beautiful moments. We can also look at the overall structure of the graph. You’ll see that there are four clusters of circles, one centering on people, one on animals, another on nature and a fourth on buildings (pulled close to nature by the sun and the sky).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can combine the data from the bubble chart and the network graph, along with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0602124.pdf&quot;&gt;segmentation&lt;/a&gt; to give us a complete overview of the tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;What is beautiful? Network Graph&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/beautifulgraph.svg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the network graph above, the size of the circles and text show how many times a tag was used, like in the bubble chart. The lines show which tags are mentioned together, while the thickness of the lines represents how often the tags were mentioned together. The colors show the results of our segmentation. There are clusters of images around beautiful people, animals, flowers, sky and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-are-the-beautiful-people&quot;&gt;Who are the beautiful people?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pictures of people seem to dominate what people perceive as beautiful. But what makes these people beautiful? Is it their hair? Their eyes? What is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out, I recruited a team of humans to analyze the images tagged with “person.” Each analyst had to answer a sequence of questions describing the properties of the images: Does the image contain a person? (The computer could have tagged incorrectly.) How long is their hair? What color is it? And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot below shows an analysis of the different properties of the beautiful people images and how they relate to each other. The properties toward the center of the plot are the ones mentioned most frequently, and the properties that are close to each other tend to appear together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/MCA.svg&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mulitple Correspondence Analysis Plot&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot shows us that an image of a person is more likely to be #beautiful if they’re young, white, females with a happy facial expression. The YWFH’s accounted for a full 23% of all images of #beautiful people, significantly higher than any other group. It also doesn’t hurt if you’re a brunette. Brunettes account for 72% of #beautiful people overall, and young, white, females with a happy facial expression and long brunette hair make up 10% of #beautiful people overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m disappointed. I never expected beauty to entirely be beholden to the beholder, but I never expected to find this level of conformity. Almost half of #beautiful pictures on Instagram are of people, and about 1 in 4 of those people photographed display the same features. While typically it’s the media that has promoted a certain standards of beauty, it’s not the media outlets posting these photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-demographics-2013-12&quot;&gt;Over 90% of Instagram users or people aged 18-35&lt;/a&gt;. Part of me (the part that watched a lot of Bill Hicks at college, wastes its time watching reruns of House and follows @neinquarterly) wants to conclude the narcissism and conformity displayed on Instagram are a malaise of a generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s it’s not that simple. That conclusion is too broad. Aristotle, Plato, Kant and Locke all failed to develop a definitive definition of beauty because beauty doesn’t have a single definition, but nor is it entirely subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best explanations of what make sometime beautiful are relative. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199229759/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199229759&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=richshaw-20&quot;&gt;In Beauty, Roger Scruton&lt;/a&gt; sees beauty as a rational judgment by the individual, that rationality has to draw up experience on the world around them. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415979927/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0415979927&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=richshaw-20&quot;&gt;Crispin Sartwell in Six Names of Beauty&lt;/a&gt; sees beauty defined by the relationship between the observer, the observed and the environment around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the #beautiful people of Instagram seem less malevolent. Uploading a picture to Instagram is a social interaction between the uploader and the other members of Instagram. Social interactions are rarely neutral. They have a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some, Instagram is a game of “likes.” The more “likes” your image gets, the better, and using popular tags like #beautiful can help with that. Others use Instagram as a way to display their perfectly curated life to friends, and #beautiful is a statement of an aspirational self-image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram photos are a product of the platform and the sample I used for the research. Instagram is a US-based company and is popular on its home turf. I also sampled images that were tagged #beautiful not &lt;a href=&quot;http://iconosquare.com/tag/precioso/&quot;&gt;#precioso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://iconosquare.com/tag/belo/&quot;&gt;#belo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://iconosquare.com/tag/%EC%95%84%EB%A6%84%EB%8B%A4%EC%9A%B4/&quot;&gt;아름다운&lt;/a&gt;. If I had looked at beautiful in different languages, I would have discovered something different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While differences between languages wouldn’t be surprising, what is surprising is the amount of homogeneity within our US leading, english tagged #beautiful images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So was suffering through high school English literature worth it? Is “beauty is in the eye of the beholder”? If it is, then with certain people in certain places a lot of us look through the same eye.&lt;/p&gt;
