<h4 id="objective--audience--data--analysis">Objective = (Audience + Data) * Analysis</h4>

<p>Before you even but pen to paper, even think about double clicking the PowerPoint icon. You need to figure out a fewer things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Who are your audience?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is your data saying?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is your data important to your audience?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you’ve answered these questions you should have a pretty good idea about what you want your diagram to say and how you want to say it to.</p>

<h4 id="sketch-out-ideas---expand--refine">Sketch out ideas - expand &amp; refine</h4>

<p>Do not, I repeat, do not, open Powerpoint. Take a blank sheet of paper and sketch out some ideas. Don’t worry if you think you can’t draw. It’s not the quality of drawing we’re worried about it’s the quality of ideas. It’s easier to come up with ideas on a blank sheet of paper than in a Powerpoint template.</p>

<p>Don’t move until you’ve sketched out at least ten ideas. Once you’ve sketched out ten ways you could visualise your data. Then choose your favourite two sketches and sketch out another ten ideas based on your favourite two. Repeat this process of expanding and refining until happy.</p>

<h4 id="designing-the-chart">Designing the chart</h4>

<p>Now you know what you want to get across and have a clear idea for your design, it’s time to create your design. Here’s a few things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The shapes on the diagram should be directly proportional to their numeric quantity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put labels on the diagram to clarify and reduce graphical distortions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this diagram in one of many, make sure you are consistent in color, layout &amp; typography. It’s good to use a grid system to make sure layouts are consistent. - Every mark made on the diagram should relate to of explain the data. Remove any unnecessary lines/shapes/labels etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be an overall macro point to your diagram, and you can have micro points which reveal themselves when the diagram is investigated in more detail. However the micro points should never detract or confuse the macro point your looking to make. - Always be guided by and refer back to your objective and your audience.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="collaborate-for-clarity">Collaborate for clarity</h4>

<p>After spending so much time figuring out how to best visually make your point there’s a danger you won’t be a to see the wood for the proverbial trees. By showing your idea to other people you will be a sense of what works and what doesn’t when someone first sees your visualisation.</p>

<h4 id="refine--practice">Refine &amp; practice</h4>

<p>It’s unlikely any diagram will be perfect first time. Go back and refine. The more you practice the visualisation of data the better you’ll become.</p>
