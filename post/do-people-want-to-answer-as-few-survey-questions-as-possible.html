      <h1>Do people want to answer as few survey questions as possible?</h1>
<p class="subtitle">April 30, 2014</p>


<p>I came across a new study, <a href="http://preibusch.de/publications/Preibusch-Krol-Beresford__voluntary_over-disclosure.pdf">The privacy economics of voluntary over-disclosure in Web forms</a>, that contained a number of interesting findings. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People give out more information than required when filling out forms online</li>
  <li>When form fields are mandatory, it causes to people to skip optional fields further on in the form</li>
</ul>

<p>Web forms are similar to surveys in physical appearance but vary in the context and motivation in which they are taken. The interesting questions for survey research raised by the web form study are: Do people want to answer as few survey questions as possible? Do mandatory questions cause people to skip optional ones?</p>

<p>To investigate this, a simple experiment was conducted. A 100-person convenience sample was recruited to take a short two-page survey. For half of the people, the questions on the first page of the survey were all mandatory, and for the other half, all the questions were optional. On the second page of the survey, all the questions were optional for everyone.</p>

<p>Two measures were taken to assess whether the mandatory questions on the first page had an effect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many of the ten optional questions were answered?</li>
  <li>What was the length of response for the final optional question, which was an open textbox question?</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly to the web form study, the survey showed that people answered more questions than required. However, mandatory questions didn’t affect how many questions were answered further on in the survey.</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Condition</th>
        <th># People</th>
        <th>Mean number of optional questions answered</th>
        <th>Mean number of characters in open response </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Mandatory</td>
        <td>43</td>
        <td>9.9</td>
        <td>42.8</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Optional</td>
        <td>57</td>
        <td>9.9</td>
        <td>40.1</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Encouragingly, people do answer survey questions they don’t have to, which is contrary to the common belief that people want to answer as few questions as possible. The experiment was too different and too small to refute the findings of the web form study. However, the contradictory findings on the effect of mandatory questions does encourage experimentation when applying ideas from other areas.</p>
