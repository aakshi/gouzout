      <h1>Did focus groups destroy britain?</h1>
<p class="subtitle">October 6, 2011</p>


<p>In 1985 Peter Mandelson was director of communications at the Labour Party, at the time MORI was Labour’s pollster. It was at this point that Philip Gould met Peter Mandelson and offered something ‘new’ in the form of the qualitative focus-groups. These focus groups stood in stark contrast to the the anonymous quantitative numbers presented by the MORI pollsters. By 1987, Gould supported by NOP were ‘in’ and MORI was ‘out’. Gould, an ad-man by trade, setup the Shadow Communications Agency and traveled to Washington regularly, becoming a expert in the American electoral techniques and aiding the Clinton election campaign in 1992.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until the 1997 election that Gould got his chance to shine. During the run up to the election the electoral strategy was informed by 300 focus groups and a further 70 were conducted after the election was called (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/British-General-Election-1997/dp/0312210795">Butler and Kavanagh,1997,129-30</a>). These focus groups were conducted to help develop a third position for Labour which occupied a political position not only between the major parties, but above them. <a href="http://sherpa.bl.uk/9/01/blpapermarch2004final.pdf">This third position was designed to appeal to swing voters whilst making it difficult for the opposition to develop and contradictory stance</a>. On one hand this program of focus groups was a ruthless strategy for winning elections on the other it aimed give people <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2499061.stm">a new politics of empowerment, participation, trust, accessibility, purpose, and perhaps above all of authenticity</a>.</p>

<p>However, these focus groups didnt entirely meet this lofty goal. The flaw in all of this is that it assumes people’s attitudes, tastes desires are constant. If people knew what they wanted, if they were completely rational and had access to all the information needed this would be fine. But a raft of evidence over recent years has proved that <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_asks_are_we_in_control_of_our_own_decisions.html">people aren’t rational and they don’t always know what they want</a> and they certainly don’t have ready access to all the information required to make policy decisions. By responding to the often contradictory whim of focus groups the Labour party abandoned long-term policy decisions to focus on the here and now. People are contradictory, irrational and by basing their decisions on these fluctuating opinions the Labour parties policies lacked any sort of coherence. Geoff Mulgan writes in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-Bad-Power-Betrayals-Government/dp/0713998822">Good and Bad Power</a>,The nearer the one came to power in the mid-1990s the shorter the time horizons were rarely looking more than a few weeks or months ahead. Their highest aspiration was simply to survive in power.</p>

<p>to Labour it seemed that didn’t matter if their policy decisions were often contradictory, because people were getting what they wanted. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user-comments/HowardDPeel">Or in the words of Derek Draper, former Labour lobbyist</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The point about focus groups politics is that there isn’t one, because people are contradictory and irrational and so you have a problem in terms of deciding what you are going to do if all you ever do is listen to a mass of individual opinions which are always fluctuating and don’t have any coherence and crucially are not set in context. So that is why people can say I want lower taxes and better public services. Of course they do. You say do you want to pay more taxes to get better public services, people are less sure, they then don’t believe that of they do pay more taxes it will be spent on better public services so you end up in this quagmire and the truth is a politician has to say “Look this is what I believe, I believe that you should pay slightly more taxes to make better public services and I pledge that I am competent enough to use that money wisely. Do you want that? Vote for me yes or no.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applying techniques used to make tactical marketing decisions to government policy was doomed to fail. This sort of short-term decision making driven by a misunderstanding of how focus groups should be used that is to blame for some of the inappropriate spending and contradictory decision making made by the last government. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/5424014/Lords-say-tripartite-system-of-financial-regulation-is-a-failure.html">The failure of the tripartite system of regulating the City</a> and the<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/jul/27/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation">ASBO initiative</a> are two ill thought out policies which have accentuated the financial and social problems currently faced by Britain.</p>

<p>The September 11th attack and the following war in Iraq the highlighted the deficiencies in this sort of short-term marketing-based decision making. There was a realisation that long-term national interests have to take precedence over the short term view of focus groups. This change in thinking was apparent when Tony Blair ignored the 1 million strong march in London protesting against the war in Iraq. <a href="http://www.everythingiknowiswrong.com/2004/09/tony_blair_ive_.html">A year later in 2004 when Tony Blair addressed the Labour Party conference he explains this change</a>,”I don’t think as a human being, as a family man, I’ve changed at all. But I have changed as a leader. I have come to realise that caring in politics isn’t really about “caring”. It’s about doing what you think is right and sticking to it.”</p>

<p>However Tony Blair’s change of heart didn’t signal the end of focus-group politics, it spread to other political parties with the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Labour all trying to to woo floating voters and occupy the middle ground. Which is why in the 2010 election there seemed to be very little to distinguish the differences between political parties in the UK or <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2010/04/the-british-election-debate-the-chastening/188149/">as Andrew Sullivan puts it</a>,”…the Brits all sound as if the national debate is within the US Democratic party”. <a href="http://www.research-live.com/blogs/aussie-pollster-blasts-labor-party-over-focus-groups/4003546.blog">This isn’t a particular characteristic of UK or US politics, the steady march of marketing thinking in politics has reached other countries like Australia with similar consequences</a>.</p>

<p>To say all of this is caused solely by focus groups and the programmes introduced by Gould, overplays their importance in political history. However, the techniques created by market researchers over the last certainly influenced the last Labour government and by using them incorrectly lay the foundations for policy decisions those shadows hang over Britain today.</p>
