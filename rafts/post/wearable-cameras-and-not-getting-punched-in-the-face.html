      <h1>Wearable cameras and not getting punched in the face</h1>
<p class="subtitle">April 24, 2014</p>


<p>I’ve been experimenting with a wearable camera called <a href="http://getnarrative.com/">Narrative Clip</a> as way of conducting ethnography. The camera is about an inch squared and simply clips on to whatever you’re wearing. The camera then automatically takes a photo every 30 seconds. I’ve put some of the outputs from the camera on a demo site called <a href="http://nequalsone.me">N = One</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Apr/clip.jpg" alt="Narrative Clip on shirt" /></p>

<p>I was worried that wearing a camera that was taking photographs all the time would be an invasion of people’s privacy and that I would upset someone or get punched in the face or possibly Tasered like my Google Glass-wearing peers. But that wasn’t the case; it was fine. I did, however, learn a few things:</p>

<p>Lots of people don’t even notice the camera. They don’t even look at it. When people do see the camera, they tend to ask you what it’s about. I explain that I’m recording my life and that it automatically takes a photograph every 30 seconds, and it doesn’t seem to bother anyone. I didn’t get any questions about privacy; nobody was upset. I think this is due to the indiscriminate operation of the camera. It takes a photograph every 30 seconds of whatever is in front of you. On the other hand, you have to tell Google Glass to take a photograph of something. With the Narrative Clip, the photograph is partly the responsibility of the machine, whereas with Google Glass, it’s the sole responsibility of the user, and this seems to make a difference regarding how people perceive the usage of the device.</p>

<p>As a person using the camera, you have to make some adjustments to your behavior; it requires a bit of self-training. It’s very easy to forget you’re wearing the camera, which is ok most of the time, but not when you come home and throw your jacket across the room, camera still attached, or even wander into a bathroom forgetting you’re wearing the camera.</p>

<p>It’s also worth thinking about what you intend to do with the images. The Narrative Clip captures gigabytes of photos a day. Way too many for you to care about. The camera is most useful when you wear it for a particular event like a party (but not in the dark; the pictures in low light are terrible) or a shopping trip.</p>

<p>The Narrative Clip, and technology like it, offers some exciting ways to document your life. It goes some way toward making a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/mylifebits/">Gordon Bell-like recording of a life</a> accessible to the masses. But along with this opportunity, there’s a need to ask why, when and how should I use this technology?</p>
